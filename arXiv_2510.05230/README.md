This is the code for http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05230, "Boundary criticality in two-dimensional correlated topological superconductors".

It is a determinant quantum Monte Carlo submodule to be included in a ALF instance. All the `.F90` and `.inc` files should be included in `${PATH_TO_ALF}/Prog/Hamiltonians/`.
Then, the module name `TSC` should be added to `${PATH_TO_ALF}/Prog/Hamiltonians.list`.

An example `parameters` file is provided as well.
